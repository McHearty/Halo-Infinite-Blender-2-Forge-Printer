# Blender to Halo Infinite Forge Bot
This Github repository hosts the necessary files and programs to build their maps in Blender 3.x, and have that map built for them in Halo Infinite Forge via Direct Input.

To download and get started, click the green "<> Code" button and select "Download Zip". Extract where you wish. Open Blender 3.x, select Edit -> Preferences -> Addons. Select install, and navigate to the extracted folder and select "Forge-For-Blender-Tubby_1_4.zip". Select the checkbox to enable it. Now you can export your Blender workspace to the format required for the Halo Infinite Forge Bot.

This program was developed by TubbyMcFatDuck and Bpsherwo.
