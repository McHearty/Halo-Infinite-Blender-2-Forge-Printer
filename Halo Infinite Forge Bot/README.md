You can test the bot to make sure it is working properly on your machine without needing to make your own Blender file or Export your current project by using the DemoPrint.DCjson file provided in the Bot Download.

NOTE: There are many factors that can slow down your ability to print at max speed with no errors. Consider the following:
Disable V-Sync
Set a stable lower FPS and a Top FPS of no more than eg. 100-120
Look up at the sky when printing your map.
Your connection to 343s Infinite servers will affect print speed

If your Bot is making errors, enable the Verbose Log option in the UI and try to replicate the issue. Video recordings + Verbose Logs of errors are the most useful way to address issues. Try tuning your Print Speed slider to go slower if you run the game under 100fps.
