*** BOT CODE VERSION 0.9.3 ***

##### HOW TO RUN THE BOT IN-GAME
1. Open the Object Browser
2. Spawn in any object
3. Go to Object Properties Menu for that object
4. Click the 'Object Name' field
5. Click Confirm
6. Without clicking on anything else or pressing any movement keys, go back to the Object Browser
7. Collapse all folders and subfolders
8. Delete the object you spawned in
9. Configure your settings/collections in the Forge Bot window
10. Press Run Bot.
11. Do not touch anything, move anything, or type anything while the Bot is processing.
12. If the Bot has an error or you for any reason need to stop the Bot IMMEDIATELY, HOLD F.
13. Otherwise, move your cursor over to "Stop" and Left-Click to stop the Bot Process when you want it to stop.

You can test the bot to make sure it is working properly on your machine without needing to make your own Blender file or Export your current project by using the DemoPrint.DCjson file provided in the Bot Download.

If your Bot is making errors, enable the Verbose Log option in the UI and try to replicate the issue. Video recordings + Verbose Logs of errors are the most useful way to address issues. Try tuning your Print Speed slider to go slower if you run the game under 120fps.

DO NOT attempt to print a DCjson OR a Collection that only contains 1 object.
